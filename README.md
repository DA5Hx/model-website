# model-website

Hey,

I have used the backend to add more cards with a button but the data stored 
is in a array and not in database as I wasn't familiar very much with them 
and there was some unsolvable error with the database that I used but I assure
to use them correctly in the near future.

Also I have used node.js as the backend server environment as I have learnt this 
and not django.

Regards,
Tanishq
