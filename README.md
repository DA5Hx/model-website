# Model-website

## How to open the website:

Since the website is hosted on a local server so to open it,
just clone the repo onto your desktop
then open the terminal and cd to the repository folder.
After that, for preventive measure run npm install or npm i onto the terminal to make sure all the files are installed on your system
then run nodemon app.js to start the server then go to any browser and connect to the localhot:3000 and the website would be loaded.
